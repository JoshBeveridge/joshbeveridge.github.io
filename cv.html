                        <p>Professional profiles are not my stength, however I understand their value and importance. I'm of the belief that in design, as in writing, your work shows your worth. To this end, I invite you to take a look at my <a href="/projects/" target="_blank">projects</a> or my <a href="/writing/design/" target="_blank">writing</a> if you'd like to better understand my skillset. To summarize, I am a systems designer and front-end developer who uses design thinking, HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build user-centric interfaces for the web. You can further explore my experience below.</p>

                        <h3>The Past</h3>
                        <p>Over the course of my time attending school, I came to the conclusion that I learn best when I'm actively producing work. Given this realization, I deferred my education in favour of practicing design. During the time I did attend post-secondary institutions, I learned the following:</p>
                        <p>At <a href="//www.ubishops.ca/">Bishop's University</a> I learned to: <strong>conduct research</strong>, <strong>think critically</strong>, and <strong>ask targeted questions</strong>.</p>
                        <p>At <a href="//nscad.ca">NSCAD University</a> I learned: <strong>the principles of design</strong>, <strong>how to prototype</strong>, and <strong>how to empathize with users</strong>.</p>

                        <h3>The Present</h3>
                        <p>Currently, my day is spent building collaborative web projects with the team at <a href="//sitebynorex.com" target="_blank">Norex</a>. As a front-end developer, I'm responsible for performing user research, user-interface design and developing the front-end code on my projects. I've also taken a keen interest in process improvement and project planning in my down time.</p>
                        <p>Beyond my work with Norex, I like to explore my other interests in a tactile way. This site is the result of my active interest in writing, and I'd like to further my curiosity of the world of editing.</p>

                        <h3>The Future</h3>
                        <p>Where I'll end up next is anyone's guess. Sharpening my front-end development skills is an ongoing priority, however I'm keen to explore my other interests in any capacity possible. I'm actively seeking opportunities to strengthen my writing, explore VR, participate in discussion and produce quality design.</p>
                        <p>If I were to summarize the direction I intend to follow, it would always return to a single core value: empathy. Whether I can achieve this through design, writing, storytelling, or development, I want to propagate and explore the understanding of how we should treat each other as human beings.
