                        <p>Professional profiles are not my stength, however I understand their value and importance. I'm of the belief that in design, or in writing, your work shows your worth. To this end, I invite you to take a look at my <a href="/projects" target="_blank">projects</a> or my <a href="/writing/design" target="_blank">design focused writing</a> if you'd like to better understand my skillset. To summarize, I am a systems designer and front-end developer who uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build user-centric interfaces for the web. You can further explore my experience below, which has been categorized by Past, Present and Future.</p>

                        <h3>The Past</h3>
                        <p>Over the course of my time attending school, I came to the conclusion that I learn best when I'm actively producing work. Given this realization, I quickly deferred my education in favour of practicing design. In the event that you're interested in what I achieved during my attendance at post-secondary institutions:</p>
                        <p>At <a href="//www.ubishops.ca/">Bishop's University</a> I learned to: <strong>conduct research</strong>, <strong>think critically</strong>, and <strong>ask targeted questions</strong>.</p>
                        <p>At <a href="//nscad.ca">NSCAD University</a> I learned: <strong>the principles of design</strong>, <strong>how to prototype</strong>, and <strong>how to empathize with users</strong>.</p>

                        <h3>The Present</h3>
                        <p>Currently, my day is spent building collaborative web projects with the team at <a href="//sitebynorex.com" target="_blank">Norex</a>. As a front-end developer, I'm responsible for performing user research, user-interface design and developing the front-end code on my projects. I've also taken a keen interest in process improvement and project planning in my down time.</p>
                        <p>Beyond my work with Norex, I'm always seeking new challenges to help me develop my skillset. I have an active interest in writing and intend to pursue it using this site as a platform.</p>

                        <h3>The Future</h3>
                        <p>There are a slew of directions my future could take, and I'm actually excited by any one of them. Sharpening my front-end development skills will always be a priority, but I'm keen to explore my other interests in any capacity possible. This means that I'm actively seeking opportunities to strengthen my writing, explore VR, participate in discussion and produce quality design.</p>
                        <p>If I were to summarize the direction I want to move in, it would always return to the core value I hold dearest: empathy. Whether I can achieve this through design, writing, illustration, or development, I want to propagate and explore the understanding of how we should treat each other as human beings. There are plenty of opportunities out there, and I'm excited to see which one pulls me in next.
