# Clone

A front-end framework that uses NPM and PostCSS.

### Getting Started

1. Clone Clone.
2. `cd clone/assets`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run clone`
5. Profit.

### PostCSS

Clone includes the following processors by default:
* postcss-import
* postcss-mixins
* postcss-nested
* autoprefixer
* postcss-simple-vars
* postcss-color-function
* cssnano

#### Compiling PostCSS

1. `cd clone/assets`
2. `npm run watch`
3. CSS away!

#### Using the Grid
Clone includes a responsive flexbox-based grid system to help with your layout stuggles.

The structure works as follows:
```
<div class="flex-grid">
    <div class="box small-1of2 med-1of3 lg-1of5">
        <!-- Content -->
    </div>
</div>
```

The `.flex-grid` class is required on the grid itself, while grid items are required to have the `.box` class. `.small-XofX`, `.med-XofX`, and `.lg-XofX` are used to address column width based on viewports:
* small refers to mobile devices
* medium refers to portrait tablet devices
* large refers to landscape tablet devices

The `XofX` portion of the class can span up to 12 columns (e.g. 1of2, 3of12).

To create a full width item, you can use the `.full`, `.small/med/lg-1of1`, or `.small/med/lg-full` classes.

#### Editing PostCSS Processors

1. Open `package.json`
2. Add your NPM Package to the `devDependencies` list.
3. Add your NPM Package to the `post` script using `-u packageName`. **Verify the order of your packages to avoid complications. Most packages should be included after `postcss-nested` and before `cssnano`.**
4. `cd clone/assets`
5. `npm install`
6. `npm run watch`
7. Profit.

### Editing Vendor Dependencies

Clone includes the following dependencies by default:
* Font Awesome
* Ionicons
* jQuery
* Match Media
* Modernizr
* Normalize

#### Adding/Removing Dependencies

1. Open `bower.json`
2. Add your Bower Package to the `dependencies` list.
3. Open `package.json`
4. Inside `scripts`, write a script that installs your Bower Package, and copies out the resulting asset into vendor. Finally, add your new script to the `clone` script. See `package.json` for examples.
5. `cd clone/assets`
6. `npm run clone`
7. Include your `assets/vendor/file_name.ext` resource in your HTML.
8. Profit.

**Please note that Clone uses `latest` in `bower.json` to pull down the most recent version of all default dependencies. If you need a specific version, replace `latest` with the correct version number before running `npm run clone`.**
