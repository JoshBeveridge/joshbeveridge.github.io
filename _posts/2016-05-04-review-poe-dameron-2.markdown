Poe Dameron #2 continues the exciting string of events surrounding Black Squadron's visit to a mysterious cult in search of Lor San Tekka. This issue introduces the series' first antagonist and establishes the framework for a proper exploration of the First Order's history. Captain Terex sheds important light on how this new organization stands apart from the Galactic Empire.

This series continues on a very strong note, highlighting quality writing with some absolutely fantastic art. The First Order's arrival signals the first real animosity of the series, and it establishes a strong connection with the atmosphere and lore the Force Awakens film put forward. The pacing in this issue is particularly well done, without any instance feeling rushed or mangled. It is clear that the issue succeeds at reassuring the reader that this is in fact a StarWars series, and that it will take its time to tell the story right.

The introduction of Captain Terex provides interesting insight into the otherwise mysterious First Order. The Force Awakens provided little context and background on how the First Order operates, and left more questions than it did answers. Terex's discussion with Phasma during the issue's flashback is particularly revealing, indicating that from Phasma's perspective, the First Order does not intend to repeat the Empire's mistakes. This diversion is important in helping the post-Return-of-the-Jedi plot evolve independently and allows it to experiment with the formula used in the original trilogy.

While the presence of a giant blue egg removes some of the credibility from the story thus far, the dialogue accompanying it is written well enough that it forces the reader to accept its prevalence. Where this is headed is still entirely up in the air, however Issue #2 results in a satisfying conclusion that leaves the reader wanting more. If these first two issues are any indication, Poe Dameron will retain this exciting trajectory that is set to explore some much needed pre-Force-Awakens history.
