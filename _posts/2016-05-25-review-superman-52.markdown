Despite its best efforts, Superman #52 is the quick and dirty result of an arc that simply lacks the spirit and heaviness it deserves. A brilliant display of artwork is left to support poor pacing and a final scene that feels inconsequential despite Superman's significant stature. Without the time and length required to tell this story, the arc finishes leaving the reader questioning its necessity.

The conclusion of the "Final Days of Superman" arc, Superman #52 embodies a heartfelt sendoff to the New 52's incarnation of the Man of Steel. Where the issue succeeds in transitioning Superman's story into the DCU Rebirth, it falls flat in most other areas, suffering from a hurried plot and a lack of meaningful dialogue. It was redeemed, in part, by Mikel Janin's superb style and fantastic panel work.

Conceptually this issue has some rather large ambitions, but these lofty goals result in poor pacing that leaves the reader feeling a little empty. There are moments where I began to believe what was happening - Clark White's entrance was absolutely superb - but for the most part, I felt that the dialogue tried too hard to be a goodbye. There was a lot of potential with the way this final issue was setup, but Lana and Lois' entrance into the book towards the end feels convenient and unnecessary. Their arrival compacts the already crowded scene and removes some of the scarce emotional impact. Despite the presence of certain characters, I find it almost disturbing that Clark would refer to Bruce as Batman in his dying moments. This also sours the moment Clark and Diana share as he immediately turns to dust.

Unfortunately, this issue misses the mark in a big way. Clark's noble intentions throughout this arc are often lost in a mess of awkward dialogue and contrived subplots that result in a less than satisfying death. Fortunately, there is a light at the end of this tunnel: Superman Rebirth promises to bring back some of Clark's best qualities. While both Supermen are fundamentally similar, I have very high hopes for Clark White's legacy incarnation and expect his character to be treated with the proper time and care it deserves.
