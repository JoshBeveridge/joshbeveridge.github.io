Action Comics issue #52 is packed full of beautiful art, and the continued presence of the Trinity helps establish a strong sense of honour and history that the New 52 books often lack. As Clark's symptoms are getting worse, this issue continues to deliver more questions than it does answers.

A continuation of the Final Days of Superman plot, Clark finds himself increasingly weaker and accompanied by the rest of the trinity. This grouping itself is a fantastic driving force during these last few issues, and it is very fitting for Clark's last adventure to be alongside Wonder Woman and Batman. Wonder Woman's presence in particular really helps ground Clark's struggle, and their romantic connection, while subtle, highlights a more human aspect that is often lost in all the action.

This issue takes the opportunity to bring all of the existing Supermen together: Clark is introduced to Clark White, who has been confronted by the mysterious imposter. While the White family's introduction doesn't feel out of place, it does feel rushed given the progression of the plot thus far. The art in these panels is uniquely attractive, showcasing a young Jon's excitable personality and the Whites' distinguishable characteristics from the exiting Clark Kent.

Given that there are two issues remaining in this arc, I am very curious and little nervous about how the conclusion will be drawn out. There are still many questions that have to be answered, and without ample page space to do so, there is concern that the plot will feel contrived and convenient. How will Clark Kent die? How will they explain the existence of the Whites? Will their name be changed to Kent come Rebirth? Only time will tell.
