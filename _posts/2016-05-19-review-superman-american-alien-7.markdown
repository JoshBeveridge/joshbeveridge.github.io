    title: Superman American Alien Issue 7
---
Superman American Alien #7 continues this series' strong take on Clark's personality, showcasing facets of the character that are rarely explored in a meaningful way. The introduction of Lobo presents itself as a great opportunity to further the foundation of the world in which these stories take place, allowing this version of Superman to feel incredibly real.

The compartmentalized stories that this series addresses really shines a light on the sheer amount of skill required to write such small impactful moments within the limited number of pages an issue provides. Issue #7 addresses a few very important moments in Clark's life without actually ever feeling rushed or awkward. The beginning of the issue brings the reader into the moment Clark admits to Jimmy that he has told Lois that he loves her. Paired with the final scene in this issue, the reader is led to believe that this version of Clark is indeed similar to that of Clark White.

The drama is interrupted by an oddity. Lobo's character will always feel a little out of place. Bringing him into this universe felt a little immersion-breaking, but the well written dialogue helps assimilate his attitude and appearance far more quickly than anticipated. Clark's introduction to Lobo is particularly well constructed, and it allows the reader to explore a vulnerable, unsure version of Superman that we rarely see. Lobo plays this to his advantage, eventually drawing out Clark's will to fight and setting the scene for some incredibly well drawn action.

American Alien does a fantastic job of bringing two very opposing sides of Superman together without ever feeling like it's trying too hard. This series consistently outshines many others by shedding a much needed light on the character behind the symbol. Superman is in fact more than the archetype he has grown to represent, and American Alien wants to make sure that you know it.
