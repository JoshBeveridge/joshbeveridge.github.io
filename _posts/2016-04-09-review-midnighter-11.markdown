Midnighter #11 highlights some of the best writing and comic art DC has in print. While the pacing of Midnighter has suffered in past issues, #11 immediately redeems any past mistakes by establishing a great character into an already great universe.

Issue #11 is a fantastic reintroduction to Apollo's character that accomplishes the impressive goal of establishing his past relationship with Midnighter while simultaneously presenting his powers and motivation as a hero. The idea behind his reintroduction made me hesitant about this issue due to the quick pace of Midnighter's plot thus far, however Orlando has written this character in flawlessly, without a single moment feeling forced or out of place.

The most captivating aspect of this issue is the way Apollo and Midnighter's interactions play out given the circumstances of their existing relationship. Orlando has written them in a way that showcases the distance between the two while highlighting the feelings that remain between them. Apollo's immediate reaction to Midnighter's call for help and their resulting conversation explores a very real and complex relationship that simply feels right. In a single issue, and despite their status, Apollo and Midnighter have become one of my favourite fictional gay couples.

The overall pacing of the issue felt more refined compared to previous issues, and despite a few mishaps that momentarily broke the immersion of the story (see Bendix ranting, or the Unified's costume), this issue's writing and art came together near-perfectly. It's impossible not to ask what will happen next, and this issue highlights Orlando's particular strength in writing a page-turner. This series remains one of the best in DC's current lineup, and raises the bar for some of the title series that are swiftly falling behind.
