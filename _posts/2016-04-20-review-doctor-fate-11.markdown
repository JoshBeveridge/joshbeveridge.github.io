Doctor Fate #11 misses the mark by attempting to address an audience younger than its plot deserves. A combination of missed opportunity and flat artistic comedy creates an atmosphere that detracts from the overall series' goal of exploring cultural and political expression in a younger generation.

Doctor Fate #11 continues a somewhat piecemeal story that places Khalid at the mercy of Julius Caesar's ghost. Given the advanced political subject matter that Doctor Fate often tries to address, I found that this issue detracted from the series' overall polish by relying heavily on exaggerated expression and misguided farce. The art, while unique and eye-catching, often peels away from the subject matter and leaves the reader disengaged from an otherwise serious conversation.

Khalid's inner monologue in this issue seemed detached and haphazard, though not enough to throw the reader off. Caesar, despite his otherwise austere historical stature, seemed insignificant and lowly, especially after his "master" was revealed towards the end of the issue. Doctor Fate's attempt to place a young man within this politically charged narration does sometimes succeed, however this issue is not the best example. It does have its moments, and while I found myself chuckling at the absurdity of a few panels, the overall tone was lost.

This series has an underlying potential to really shine with its unique direction and particular style, but it often misses the mark by pairing an oblivious protagonist with situations that are not treated with the seriousness they deserve.
