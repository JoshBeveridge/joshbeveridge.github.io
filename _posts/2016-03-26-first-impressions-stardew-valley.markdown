Stardew Valley is a very carefully crafted work of art from a powerful storyteller and skilled developer. [@ConcernedApe](//twitter.com/ConcernedApe)'s journey towards publishing this game echoes the sheer amount of work and love that went into its creation. Stardew Valley is more than a farming sim, and branches into the realms of action, adventure and RPG.

#### What Is Stardew Valley?

This quaint little masterpiece begins with a very real commentary on day-to-day life. Your character begins their journey by shedding their monotonous career working for JojaMart by accepting a generous plot of land from their late grandfather. Without having moved my character once, this game spoke to a part of me I didn't know existed. From this point on, I knew I had discovered something incredible.

Stardew Valley, at its heart, is an escape to a simpler time, where the player can focus on building their own business, establishing relationships with incredible townsfolk, and building a life for themselves in this little corner of paradise. From harvesting corn to playing arcade machines, Stardew Valley offers an impressively wide variety of game mechanics to hook the player into hours of refined, quality content.

<h4 class="section">Where the Game Succeeds</h4>

##### Play Mechanics & Scale

The player's first day on their brand new farm is one of the most overwhelming aspects of the game. Without any specific direction, the player is provided with a couple parsnip seeds, basic tools, and a quest asking them to introduce themselves to the rest of the townsfolk. These few introductory tasks alone seem daunting, however, as you explore your land and carve out your own little garden, the game gently begins to hint towards much more complicated systems.

Stardew Valley has a lot to offer: you can farm, raise animals, fall in love, make friends, fish, mine, fight monsters, unlock secrets and even save the town from your former employer. It becomes very obvious early in the game that there are layers to these activities and the pacing of the days and seasons helps ease the player into developing a routine. This becomes key as the player progresses - the game reveals its scale at an appropriate speed, helping the player learn as they expand their skill set.

##### Storytelling

Beyond the numerous activities that take place on the farm, the player very quickly discovers that their new plot of land is a small part in a much larger community. Pelican Town offers much more than housing the shops and services the player will need access to. Characters, events and secrets appear at every turn, and the town succeeds at feeling alive. Each season during the year provides the player with new and exciting events to participate in. Modeled after real world holidays, these community gatherings include an Egg Hunt in the spring, Spirit's Eve in the fall and even the Feast of the Winter Star to help get the player through the cold.

##### Art Direction

The in-game art style is a fantastic choice that returns many players (myself included) to a simpler time in gaming. This couples very well with the overarching theme of the game. This particular style provides the game with a quaint, colourful palette, reminiscent of early Gameboy Advance. The modern variety however, is where the game's art truly shines. Seasonal differences, item design, and character art all vary greatly while maintaining a cohesive presence. This is coupled with an incredibly catchy, custom score that ties the entire setting together and breathes life into each and every locale.

##### Skill Development and Play Variety

The incredibly well designed atmosphere is paired with an equally well designed skill system that propels the game's purpose beyond that of games such as Harvest Moon. The player's character has a set list of skills that they can master over the course of the game. Each skill can grow to reach 10 different levels, and each level provides the player with new crafting recipes or perks. Skills can be customized at levels 5 and 10 to provide more control over the characters playstyle. This provides numerous opportunities to change the way your farm generates income and customizes the experience to suit that particular player's interests.

##### Character Development & Relationships

One of the most charming aspects of the game is the community that [@ConcernedApe](//twitter.com/ConcernedApe) has constructed to provide Stardew Valley with its setting. Pelican Town is home to a variety of characters who have their own unique backgrounds, tastes, activities and events. The player is provided with the opportunity to become friends with any one of these characters over the course of their play through by chatting with them and providing gifts that appeal to their tastes. As the player's relationships progress, small cutscenes occur that further reveal that particular characters personality. Most impressively, each character has been written well enough to feel and react in a realistic fashion. Cutscenes vary from heartache to hot air balloons and highlight the best these characters have to offer.

This mechanic is further refined through a marriage system. Players are allowed to woo one of 10 (soon to be 12!) characters by offering them gifts and flowers. Over time the player discovers an item that provides them with the opportunity to ask their beau/belle to marry them. This, in turn, opens up the abiltiy to have and provide for a family. Most importantly, [@ConcernedApe](//twitter.com/ConcernedApe) has done a splendid job allowing any character to be romanced by any player, allowing LGBT players to live out their farming dreams as they so please.

##### Secrets, Rewards & Play Addiction

One of the most obvious reasons Stardew Valley succeeds at retaining a player's attention is the sheer number of details that hint towards hidden or otherwise locked content. Pelican Town holds its fair share of secrets, and the game rarely provides a direct path to revealing them. From locked sewers to a mysterious Wizard, these oddities consistently tantalize the player into believing every little corner of the game serves a purpose. More often than not, Stardew Valley rewards this stubborn curiosity, and it does so in a manner that is almost always satisfying. This allows players to explore for hours on end without ever feeling that they haven't accomplished something great. Paired with a save system that only allows the player to record their progress before the next day begins, Stardew Valley demands the player's attention in every way possible.

##### Endgame Content

After having invested over 70 hours of in-game time developing my farm, I am still not satisfied with my progression. This might make it sound unfair if I say that end-game content is one of this game's flaws, however it is out of fear that I highlight the end. Stardew Valley does a very good job of enticing the player to keep exploring, farming and mining. This however comes at a cost. As the player nears level 10 in their skill lines, a wall begins to form that prevents the activities from retaining their excitement. The success of this game is thanks to its scale, and this is in part the issue with its end: there is one. The opportunity for the player to plateau is terrifying, especially after investing so much time and love into this seemingly alive little town. This problem, however frustrating, might not require the solution I hope it receives. It would be easy and selfish to ask for indefinite content, but this already fantastic game is a labour of love, and it is extremely important to know when enough is enough.

##### Controls

The second major flaw that plagues this game is an inaccurate set of controls. Initially, the game feels very responsive, but as the player warms up to the controls, they develop an eagerness and memory for certain activities. This begins to reveal certain inaccuracies or mishaps that can occur by miss-clicking or targeting the wrong square. More than one pig has been accidentally milked and dozens of crops sacrificed in the name of tilling the land. A handy setting allows the player to turn on tile targeting, however I believe that more reliable, accurate controls would benefit the experience tremendously.

<h4 class="section">What I Hope Comes Soon</h4>

##### Marriage Events

To help alleviate some of the post-marriage stagnation, [@ConcernedApe](//twitter.com/ConcernedApe) has already made welcome updates to dialogue and spousal activities to help your farm feel more alive. This update was appreciated, but I expect that development will continue to help marriage feel more dynamic and less like a dead end. The most charming aspect of Stardew Valley is learning about each character's struggles, hopes and dreams. Given their state of complexity, I feel that there is plenty of room for growth and diversity that will propel these relationships even further, encouraging the player to explore and uncover new and exciting aspects of their favourite NPCs.

##### Mine Difficulty

The mines offer a fantastic exploratory aspect to the game, however they fall flat when the player reaches late stages in their play through. The progression from one mine to the next is a fantastic way to provide new challenge (especially considering how much the player has to discover before hand), and I see this being expanded over time to provide more content. Enemy variety is a key part of how this could be shaped, opening new possibilities for kill quests and item drops. Progressive difficulty would also provide endgame players with the chance to test their mettle and challenge each other to get to deeper levels.

##### House Customization

Finally, a more labourious request would be to provide the player with the ability to construct the interior of their home manually, allowing them to use materials to build walls and expand their houses of their own ability. By providing walls, flooring and possibly new levels for the house, the player would be able to create the home that suits their playstyle. The in-game pay gate to increase the house's functionality allows for many more opportunities to create unique and useful rooms that can house new mechanics, items and collections.

Stardew Valley is a game that deserves the tremendous amount of praise it has received since launch. One developer's journey to create a very sincere experience has blossomed into a fan favourite that has captured the hearts of thousands of players. Its particular charm and impressive attention to detail help it stand out from a crowded market, highlighting the immense amount of work and soul that went into its creation. Regardless of what's next for Pelican Town, this game has easily earned a respectable place among my favourite games.
