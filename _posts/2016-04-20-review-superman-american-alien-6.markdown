The American Alien series achieves a mighty goal of reaching into the depths of Superman's history and pulling out some of the best events that establish him as a believable character. Issue #6 takes this a step further, placing Clark amongst his friends and creating a relatable context for the reader that provides the opportunity to establish a proper connection with the Man of Steel.

American Alien achieves its primary goal splendidly in issue #6: show the world that Clark Kent is a person. Issue #6 explores the complex layers to this otherwise all-powerful being that makes him relatable and real. It is precisely for this reason that this series succeeds in reinventing DC's most iconic character.

Pete and Kenny, Clark's friends from Smallville, are written in to this issue in a way that feels natural and wholly realistic. These characters, aware of Clark's identity as Superman, explore a very important scenario in which Clark's identity becomes a burden that he can't shoulder alone. This single flaw creates the opportunity for the reader to form a relationship with an often cold and robotic superhero that opens up a whole new realm of possibility. Paired with the organic and believable dialogue that occurs between Clark and his friends, this single plot device allows this issue to outshine its siblings.

The issue is paced well overall, and despite Clark's tantrum that sends him flying into space (to provide context for the Green Lantern Corps and Krypton), I felt that the conclusion felt complete. The minor cliffhanger at the end helps establish a continuity that doesn't ruin the completion of the particular issue, and I feel that American Alien achieves this mechanic more successfully with each book.
