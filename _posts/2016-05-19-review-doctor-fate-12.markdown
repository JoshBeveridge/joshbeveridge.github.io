Issue #12 brings an expected level of development to the series, redeeming the last few issues' haphazard scenes and misguided political gravity. The introduction of a new, important character helps establish a foundation that will allow this book to explore a more historic perspective on the Doctor Fate mythology.

The previous issue of Doctor Fate left something to be desired in terms of its tone and coherence. What that issue lacked, #12 made up for in excess. A sharp reduction in humour and a much more cohesive experience helps the reader fly through this book, and while there are moments that feel a little unnecessary, the story progresses in an extremely meaningful way.

Khalid starts off at an evaluation of his status as a student in his prestigious med school, and this scene really helps bring the series back to earth. It reminds us that Khalid is indeed a character that extends beyond Doctor Fate's helmet and a slew of inner monologue. The Dean's sudden heart attack seems a little convenient, however it is a dependable segue that efficiently moves the story back into the realm of Anubis. While this scene feels a little pointless at its resolution, it is redeemed by fantastic art, and some great paneling work.

What this scene does help establish is the fact that Khalid is growing into his powers and beginning to learn that he can take matters into his own hands. This is a great moment for this type of growth to occur, as the final pages of this issue reintroduces an extraordinarily important character to the series: Kent Nelson. The appearance of the original Doctor Fate is a welcome surprise, and I expect his influence will help facilitate this series' growth and evolution. With his arrival, an entirety of Doctor Fate history and development suddenly becomes accessible, hopefully allowing this book to become the successor we want it to be.
