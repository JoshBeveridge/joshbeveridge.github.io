Action Comics #51 follows Clark and Kara as they explore what it means to be super, and how Clark expects his cousin to meet the needs of Earth when he is gone. Despite the issue's pacing feeling rushed, the sincerity of the relationship between the two characters helps overpower the eagerness Clark expresses towards his own death.

Action Comics #51 continues the story of Clark trying to locate Kara before his untimely end. With the intention of passing on his legacy to his cousin, Clark finally succeeds in reaching Kara as she's being tested on (willingly) by a few friendly scientists. The issue, when compared to its predecessor, suffers from poor pacing and jarring cuts from scene to scene. The issue is redeemed however, by the detailed art that brings a special charm to Clark and Kara's interactions.

Despite collapsing and having suffered a severe wound at the hands of spontaneous Chinese elementals (an overpowering nod to the future New Super-Man series), Clark's dialogue increasingly indicates to the reader that he is almost excited to meet his end. This is emphasized heavily in this issue which unfortunately pushes Clark beyond a sense of nobility into the realm of falsehood. Given the remaining time between the issue's release and the DCU Rebirth event, it's understandable that these last few scenes lack the structure they deserve.

Despite this eagerness, Clark's nature does shine through and reveals a fitting end to his legacy. Despite the following quote feeling a little forced, it hits home an important message:

>"Be the stone, Kara, because it's the ripples that change the world."

His arrival at the Fortress of Solitude and the passing of the true key to Kara echoes the importance of the mantle he is passing down. The issue explores the nature of what Superman is to the rest of the world and how someone else might come to fill those mighty shoes when the Man of Steel is finally no more.
