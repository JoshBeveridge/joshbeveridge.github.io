In a final farewell, Midnighter explores the conclusion to the Suicide Squad conflict while highlighting some of the best aspects of the series' run. Violence, passion and wittiness abound as Midnighter and Apollo shake free of the confines of their 12 issue run and establish themselves as fully-fledged LGBT DCU characters.

The final installment in the Midnighter series does an absolutely incredible job of providing fans with a meaty, satisfying exploration of what makes Midnighter so unbelievably unique. This issue is packed with every single piece of Orlando's vision for this character: power, arrogance, passion, violence, acceptance and love. It excels at tying off the series on the highest note possible without sacrificing its quality or integrity.

Issue #12 is stuffed full of beautiful art and ACO's unique take on Midnighter's paneling helps keep the reader focused and properly immersed throughout. A healthy dose of classic violence accompanies an otherwise tender send off to this character and his world. The antagonists and subsequent plot took a backseat to this farewell, but they did so gently, and provided adequate resolution as to tie the plot off without detracting from the overall experience.

This series has provided something so much more powerful than quality writing or a fresh take on the superhero genre; it put an LGBT character on the cover of his own story. Midnighter succeeds at avoiding the label of "gay superhero" and shows that a badass, violent vigilante can just so happen to be gay. He does so in a way that shows the world that being gay really isn't all that different. Heartbreak, angst, love... they are all present in a very real way for this character, but they don't exclusively define him, and this provides the DCU with a perspective no other character has ever been able to do properly.

Kudos to [Steve Orlando](//twitter.com/thesteveorlando) and [ACO](//www.facebook.com/aco.aco.188) for creating a series that has achieved so much more than they'll ever be able to know. In 12 issues, Midnighter has become one of my favourite superheroes.
