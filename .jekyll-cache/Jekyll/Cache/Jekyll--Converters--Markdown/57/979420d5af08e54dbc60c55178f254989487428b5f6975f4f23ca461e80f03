I"Ì<p>Design has become a muddled word. Among its many, varied, definitions one can quite easily find a niche in which to exist. Graphic design, interior design, brand design, web design, the list goes on. Each is different and corresponds to a distinct skill set. There is however, a core to these systems; one that has been stretched and manipulated in order to cut costs and create efficient processes that allow design to exist within ever-shrinking budgets. The core of design has eroded as a result of these efforts, and itâ€™s time that those calling themselves as designers start fighting for the ability to really do their job, or start looking for a better, more definitive term for the role they occupy.</p>
