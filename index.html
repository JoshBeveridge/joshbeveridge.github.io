        <h3>0. Josh</h3>
        <p>I’m a person who builds things. I use the web as a tool, and it provides me with one of the best canvases out there.  I prefer to spend my focus on function, and usability will always trump aesthetic. See something that bothers you here? Get in touch, because change is my favourite thing about life.</p>

        <h3>1. Designer</h3>
        <p>Design can, and does, change the world. The ability to iterate an idea and guide its evolution into exactly what its user needs is something I cherish every single day. Coupled with good intentions and the right tools, a designer has what I consider to be the equivalent of magic.</p>

        <h3>2. Gamer</h3>
        <p>When I’m not building, I’m waging the war on digital evil. Whether I’m fighting the Darkspawn in <a href='#'>Dragon Age</a> or foiling Team Rocket’s plans for world domination in <a href='#'>Pokemon</a>, I am a gamer at heart. I slay dragons in my spare time, what do you do?</p>

        <h3>3. Comic Lover</h3>
        <p>My hero? <strong>Clark Kent</strong>. I can’t ask for a better role model, because in a world dominated by challenges and inevitable failure, I’ve learned that getting back up and doing what’s right will always get me where I need to be.</p>
